*"Using blockchain to validate true love"*

(Better name coming soon)

The whole idea is to use a proprietary frontend (dating website) on a free and
open source backend (the blockchain) to form a peer-to-peer network dating
service that can be easily usable and accessable on any device, be it a phone or
computer. 

**transaction:**
1. 'I found true love'
2. Goes up to the blockchain as 1 credit (a heart)
