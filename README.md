*"Using blockchain to validate true love"*

The whole idea is to use a proprietary frontend (dating website) on a free and
open source backend (the blockchain) to form a peer-to-peer network dating
service that can be easily usable and accessable on any device, be it a phone or
computer. 

**transaction:**
1. 'I found true love' -- user clicks button, proof of love/anonymous submission
2. If both users do that, it gets saved on the blockchain anonymously
3. Goes up to the blockchain as 1 credit (a heart)

The **fact** that they have found true love will go down as a transaction in the blockchain and that transaciton will be considered a tally. in other words, a creditblitiy will be made -- or a unit of crediblity -- IF our app finds true live. 

The analytics gathered from the anonymous transactions can have the business model worked in with it.
